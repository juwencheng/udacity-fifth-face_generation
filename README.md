# udacity-fifth-face_generation
Udacity DLND final project . Use GAN generate face


I've made so many mistakes. By reading udacity forumns and slack conversation. I change my way to train model, I don't just concerned about loss, but the outcome. If the model give me a nice outcome, and the loss is high, I also think it's a good model.

I am so proud that part of the outcome looks like a real person. I will continue to train my model !
